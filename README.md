## Usage Guidelines

1. Always monitor temperatures when running stress tests
2. Start with one tool at a time to isolate potential issues
3. Keep these tools updated to their latest versions
4. Use multiple tools to verify stability
5. Save baseline results before making changes

## Safety Warning

⚠️ **Overclocking carries risks and may void your warranty. Always proceed with caution and ensure proper cooling.**

- Monitor temperatures constantly
- Make small, incremental changes
- Document your settings
- Have a way to reset BIOS/CMOS if needed
- Ensure adequate power supply and cooling
